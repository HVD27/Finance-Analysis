### Financial Transaction Analysis and Fraud Detection

---

## Project Overview

This project is designed to analyze a financial transaction dataset, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), develop machine learning models for categorizing transactions, detect potential fraud, and generate financial insights. The dataset used for this project is the "Credit Card Fraud Detection" dataset, which contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. This dataset is highly imbalanced, with the majority of transactions being non-fraudulent.

## Files and Structure

- **`transaction_analysis.py`**: The main Python script containing the entire code for data loading, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model development, and insights generation.

- **`creditcard.csv`**: The dataset used in this project. This file needs to be downloaded separately from Kaggle and placed in the same directory as the Python script.

- **`README.md`**: This file, providing an overview of the project, instructions for setup, and usage.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn imbalanced-learn statsmodels
```

## Dataset

The dataset used is the "Credit Card Fraud Detection" dataset from Kaggle. You can download it from [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud). After downloading, place the `creditcard.csv` file in the same directory as the Python script.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Download the Dataset**:
   - Go to the [Kaggle page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) and download the dataset.
   - Extract the ZIP file to get the `creditcard.csv` file.
   - Place the CSV file in the same directory as the script.

2. **Run the Script**:
   - Execute the Python script `transaction_analysis.py` using your preferred method (e.g., command line, IDE).
   - The script will load the dataset, perform exploratory data analysis, train machine learning models, and output insights on financial transactions.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - The script includes visualizations to understand transaction amounts, distribution over time, and differences between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.
   - These visualizations are automatically generated and displayed as the script runs.

4. **Model Development**:
   - The script includes training a balanced Random Forest model to classify transactions as fraud or non-fraud.
   - Hyperparameter tuning is performed using GridSearchCV to optimize the model.
   - An anomaly detection model (Isolation Forest) is also included to identify potentially fraudulent transactions.

5. **Insights Generation**:
   - The script generates financial insights such as spending patterns, anomaly detection, and predictions of future expenses using ARIMA.
   - Insights include identifying high-spending months and suggesting saving opportunities.

## Customization

- **Dataset**: If you want to use a different dataset, ensure it has a similar structure (e.g., transaction amounts, timestamps). Modify the data loading and preprocessing steps as needed.

- **Models**: You can experiment with different machine learning models by replacing the Random Forest classifier with other classifiers like Logistic Regression, XGBoost, etc.

- **Parameters**: Adjust hyperparameters in the GridSearchCV section to further optimize the model.

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing Values**: If there are missing values in the dataset, consider handling them by filling with mean/median values or dropping affected rows/columns.

- **Date Formatting**: Ensure that the `Date` column is properly formatted as a datetime object before running time series analysis.

- **Long GridSearchCV Execution**: GridSearchCV may take a long time to run. You can reduce the number of parameters or folds in the cross-validation to speed up the process.

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive approach to analyzing financial transaction data, detecting fraud, and generating valuable financial insights. By following the instructions in this README, you can replicate the analysis and extend it according to your specific needs.
